# Responsive-Portfolio
In this project, I created a website in order to give potential enployers a portfolio to both get to know me and get in touch. This is an important project because it tought me the powers of bootstrap. A website that would have taken a long time with normal css took me two days to complete with bootstrap. Unfortunately it does not contain java script, but that will be the next step of the portfolio. Each page has a nav bar that can bring you between pages, and it uses a grid system to make sure that it is all device compatible.

When you first open the cite, the first bage you will be brough to is an about me page. It includes a picture along with a paragraph about myself. 

The if you look at the navbar, the next page you can click on is my portfolio. With a fully layed out grid, it eill display 5 of my best projects along with a picture of them (coming soon).

The last page is a contact page. Anyone will be able to send me and email with their name along with a message if they choose. More ways to get in contact with me are layed out in the footer, coming along with a matching logo.
